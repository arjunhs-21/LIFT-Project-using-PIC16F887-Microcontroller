# LIFT PROJECT
In this project, the PIC16F887 acts as the central controller that processes input signals and manages outputs. A PIR sensor is used to detect human presence near the lift entrance, automatically activating the lift mechanism or display when someone is nearby. A toggle switch functions as a manual control, allowing users to select or simulate floor requests. The LCD display provides visual feedback, such as current floor level, direction of movement, or occupancy detection. When a person approaches the lift, the PIR sensor sends a signal to the microcontroller, which then activates the LCD to show status or instructions. Based on the toggle switch input, the microcontroller simulates lift movement by updating the floor display accordingly.
